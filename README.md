# The Won Cause Website

http://woncause.com

This is the very first site I built that got put onto the Internets. Hell,
I was just a kid (at heart, not age) when I did this. So young, so unaware
of building a website any other way.

Now I know what you are thinking, "Oh, this must be from the 90's." Well my
friend, you are wrong. This bad boy is circa 2011.

# But Why?

I really just have this here for a few reasons:

1. Nostalgic purposes - I mean this is my first website.
2. Humbling purposes - I had to start somewhere.
3. Frame of reference - It is nice to see how I have progressed.
