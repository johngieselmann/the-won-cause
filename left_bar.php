                    		Clink on the above link for a list of the all-black posts identified in the book, The Won Cause, Appendix I. Others may have existed, but these are the ones that were found during this study. The list in incomplete for the very reason the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) was unique: the GAR almost never officially labeled a post as “Colored.”  The list is neither comprehensive nor necessarily error free. It relies on the GAR having recorded accurate information, such as the unit a veteran had served in during the Civil War. As a result, identifying African American posts and their location is an ongoing process. If you know of any black posts that I have not listed here, please use the “Contact Us” link and this table will be updated.

Other integrated posts may have existed, but these are the ones that were found during this study. The list is neither comprehensive nor necessarily error free. The record is likely incomplete because GAR members rarely described a post as interracial. As a result, identifying integrated posts and their location is an ongoing process.
